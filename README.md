Replicating the experiments described in the paper "The Role of Environmental Variations in Evolutionary Robotics"

The experiments have been carried out and can be replicated by using [evorobotpy2](https://github.com/snolfi/evorobotpy2)  

For an introduction to the theory and to state-of-the-art research in this areas, see the associated open-access book [Behavioral and Cognitive Robotics: An Adaptive Perspective](https://bacrobotics.com)
