Replicating the experiments described in the paper "The Role of Environmental Variations in Evolutionary Robotics"

The experiments have been carried out and can be replicated by using [evorobotpy2](https://github.com/snolfi/evorobotpy2) and by modifying the source code as described below. 

To learn to use evorobotpy see the Chapter 13 of open-access book [Behavioral and Cognitive Robotics: An Adaptive Perspective](https://bacrobotics.com)
